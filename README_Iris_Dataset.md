# K-MEANS

K-Means Clustering for Iris Data

Introduction:
This Python script demonstrates K-Means Clustering using the Iris dataset. K-Means is an unsupervised machine learning technique used for data segmentation. The goal here is to group similar Iris flowers based on their sepal and petal measurements.

Steps:

Data Loading: The code starts by importing necessary libraries and loading the Iris dataset from an Excel file.

Data Preprocessing: It removes an unnecessary column and normalizes the data to ensure all features have the same scale.

Elbow Method: The script uses the Elbow Method to determine the optimal number of clusters (k) for K-Means. It iterates through k values, performs K-Means clustering, and computes the Within-Cluster Sum of Squares (WCSS). The plot shows an "elbow" point to select the appropriate k.

Data Visualization: After determining the optimal k (in this case, 3), it applies K-Means clustering to the data and assigns each data point to a cluster. The script then creates a scatter plot to visualize the clusters based on sepal length and width.

Outcome: The code helps identify distinct groups of Iris flowers in the dataset using K-Means clustering and visualizes the results.

This code is a useful reference for data clustering and visualization tasks using K-Means with the Iris dataset.
